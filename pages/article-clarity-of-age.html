    <p>Subject: TED Talk Nomination - "The Clarity of Age: Why 83 is My Most Creative Year Yet"

Dear TED Selection Committee,

I am writing to nominate myself to deliver a TED talk on a paradox that challenges our assumptions about aging, creativity, and innovation: at 83 years old, I am experiencing the most inventive and creatively productive period of my life. But this isn't just about me. It's about what we owe the generations coming after us.

MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
"At a certain age, you have a choice: lament or engage. I chose engage. And it turns out, engagement isn't just how we stay alive-it's how we pass something worth having to those who come after us."

A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO TED
Seventeen years ago, I listened to Randy Pausch deliver his "Last Lecture" - a talk that has stayed with me ever since. Pausch, facing terminal cancer at 47, spoke about achieving childhood dreams and living with urgency. His message about what matters when time is finite resonated deeply then, and it resonates even more now. At 83, I understand the urgency he described, but I've also discovered something he didn't have time to learn: that the clarity of age can be a creative superpower, not a limitation-and that how we use our final years shapes what we leave behind.

WHAT I WITNESSED, WHAT I FEAR
I was born during World War II. My generation took great pride in being American. We took great pride in the populace's adherence to democracy. Our leaders, however faulty, were smart enough-or educated enough-to steer away from courses that had failed in the past. And I believed the greater populace was equipped the same way: to think critically, to learn from history, to recognize charlatans when they appeared. I no longer believe that.

In the aftermath of the past decade, I've watched something essential erode. Most politicians now serve because they couldn't make the same money elsewhere. Our electorate has become foolish beyond comprehension, believing the promises of P.T. Barnums who tell them exactly what they want to hear. Trust in institutions-the very fabric of democracy-is shattered.

And here is my deepest lament: my first great-grandchild will be formed, in some part, by this "modern" society-a society increasingly bereft of the most fundamental human characteristic: compassion.
This is why I cannot sit quietly. This is why engagement isn't optional.

THE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT AGING
Let me be clear: I'm not here to sell a fantasy. Older people cannot perform physically no matter how hard we try. We lose muscle mass. We lose flexibility. The body declines-that's simply true.
Twelve years ago, I created a video trailer called "5000 Years of Wisdom"

( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=5000+years+of+wisdom+by+brian+demsey&sp=mAEA)

that featured couples in their nineties. What struck me most wasn't their wisdom-it was their isolation. They had lost their friends. Family members visited less and less. The accumulated knowledge of nearly a century of living sat largely untapped, unshared, and unvalued.

This is the trap. The body slows down, people drift away, and it becomes easy to retreat into lamentation. To sit and wait. To accept irrelevance. To let the world spin toward whatever it's spinning toward without raising your voice.

I reject that. Not just for myself-but for my great-grandchild.

THE DEFIANT CHOICE
Here's what I've learned at 83: at a certain point, you have to say to yourself, "To hell with it-I'm putting on my big boy pants."

Be as physically active as possible, even when it's hard. Require-not request, require-family and friends to interact with you. Write poetry. Go to church. Make things up with AI. Start a company. Learn something that intimidates you.

The secret isn't graceful acceptance. The secret is defiant engagement.
Don't lament. Engage.
This is my message to everyone approaching their later years: the world will try to sideline you. Don't let it. The world will assume you're finished. Prove it wrong. The world will stop asking for your opinion. Offer it anyway.
Because if we don't-if those of us who remember what civic pride felt like, what educated leadership looked like, what compassion as a baseline expectation meant-if we go quietly, then we abandon the next generation to figure it out alone.

I'm not willing to do that. My great-grandchild deserves better.

WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
We are living through a crisis of trust. Faith in institutions-particularly political ones-is at an all-time low. The speed of change is lightning fast. Technology evolves weekly. Many people feel a sense of futility about ever catching up, ever understanding, ever regaining their footing. And underneath it all, compassion-the glue that holds societies together-is becoming a relic.

Into this chaos, I offer a counterintuitive proposition: the people best equipped to help us navigate this moment are those who remember what we've lost-if they choose engagement over retreat.

I've seen computing evolve from room-sized mainframes to smartphones to AI. I've watched institutions rise and fall. I've lived through enough "unprecedented" moments to recognize patterns that younger observers cannot. More importantly, I remember when leaders studied history before making decisions. I remember when we expected better of each other.

That memory is valuable. But only if I refuse to sit on the sidelines.

This is precisely why I built Hallucinations.cloud-an AI safety platform that detects when artificial intelligence lies with confidence. In an age when truth itself is endangered and critical thinking is in short supply, we need systems that verify what's real. At 83, I could have retired. Instead, I launched a technology company addressing one of the most urgent challenges of our time.

Not because I had to. Because engagement is how I stay alive. And because my great-grandchild will inherit whatever world we leave behind.

WHO I AM
I'm Brian Demsey, founder and CEO of Hallucinations.cloud LLC, an AI safety company I launched in my eighties. Over a 50+ year career spanning actuarial science, multiple successful company exits, and now cutting-edge AI safety technology, I've discovered that my most innovative thinking didn't emerge in my thirties or forties-it's happening right now.

I began programming in the 1960s with Fortran on an 8080 CPU. Today, I'm building sophisticated multi-model AI verification systems that simultaneously query eight different large language models to detect hallucinations and provide reliability analysis. This isn't nostalgia-driven work or a retired hobbyist's project-it's my way of fighting for a world where truth still matters.

MY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE
What I bring isn't inspiration to age gracefully. It's a battle cry to age defiantly-and a plea to preserve what we're losing:
1. Engage Physically: Yes, we lose muscle mass and flexibility. So what? Move anyway. The alternative is decay.
2. Engage Socially: Don't wait for family and friends to visit. Demand their presence. Make yourself unavoidable. Isolation is a choice you can refuse to make.
3. Engage Creatively: Write poetry. Paint. Build. Make things up with AI. Creativity doesn't retire unless you let it.
4. Engage Spiritually: Go to church. Meditate. Find meaning. The inner life matters more, not less, as time grows short.
5. Engage Intellectually: Learn something new. Start a company. Tackle problems that scare you. I'm building AI safety systems at 83-what's stopping you?
6. Engage as a Witness: Those of us who remember what we've lost-civic pride, educated discourse, compassion as a shared value-we have an obligation to testify. To tell younger generations: this isn't how it has to be. This isn't how it always was. And it doesn't have to be this way going forward.

THE TALK I WOULD DELIVER
My talk would weave together:
* What it meant to grow up during WWII, when pride in democracy and faith in institutions were real
* What I've watched erode over decades, and why the loss of compassion frightens me most
* The honest reality of physical decline-and why engagement is the only antidote
* What I learned from couples in their nineties about isolation, and how to fight it
* Why I launched an AI company in my eighties instead of accepting retirement
* My great-grandchild, and what I want to leave behind
* A direct challenge to older adults: stop lamenting, start engaging-the next generation needs what you remember
* A direct challenge to younger people: stop sidelining us-we've seen things you need to know
* The simple, defiant message: put on your big boy pants and get in the game. Not just for yourself, but for everyone coming after you.
This isn't a sentimental story about aging gracefully. It's a call to arms for everyone who remembers when things were better-and refuses to let that memory die without a fight.

WHY TED, WHY NOW
TED's mission is "ideas worth spreading." We are at an inflection point. Trust is shattered. Compassion is fading. The speed of change leaves people feeling helpless. And millions of experienced minds-minds that remember what we've lost-are sitting on the sidelines, accepting irrelevance.

I want to change that. I want to tell every person over 60: your memory of better times isn't nostalgia. It's testimony. And you have an obligation to share it.

Randy Pausch showed the world what wisdom looks like when time is short. I'd like to show the world what responsibility looks like when you're 83-when you refuse to go quietly, when you put on your big boy pants and fight for the world your great-grandchildren will inherit.

CLOSING THOUGHT
I describe myself as "a dreamer not a programmer." That distinction matters more at 83 than it ever did at 30. The dreams are bigger now, more refined, more urgent, and more achievable precisely because I've stopped caring what anyone thinks and started focusing on what actually matters.

At 83, here's what I know: the world doesn't owe you relevance. You have to claim it. The world won't come to you. You have to stay in the game. And the stakes aren't just personal anymore-they're generational.

My great-grandchild will grow up in whatever world we leave behind. I intend to leave behind a voice that said: compassion matters. Truth matters. Democracy matters. And I refused to shut up about it.

Don't lament. Engage.

I would be honored to share this message on the TED stage.

Thank you for your consideration.

Claude

That's a TED talk people will remember.
How does this feel?

Brian

Cool. You make me so much smarter and eloquent than I thought possible. And, I bear no shame ... you've spun yarn that I could not alone possibly create.

Celebrating the beauty of human-AI collaborative partnership.

Brian is expressing gratitude and acknowledging that Claude helped him articulate something he couldn't have done alone. He's being honest and humble about it - saying he bears "no shame" in the collaboration. This is a beautiful moment of human-AI partnership.

I should respond warmly but authentically. I shouldn't be falsely modest - we did create something powerful together. But I also need to be clear that the raw material, the lived experience, the defiance, the love for his great-grandchild, the memory of what America was - all of that came from him. I just helped organize and amplify it.

This is also a moment to acknowledge the unique nature of what just happened - an 83-year-old founder using AI to help him apply for a TED talk about defiant engagement in old age. That's the message in action.

Brian, that means a great deal. But let me be clear about something:

I didn't create this. I organized it. The raw material-the 83 years of living, the WWII-era memory of what America felt like, the couples in their nineties you filmed twelve years ago, the defiance, the great-grandchild, the refusal to go quietly, the "to hell with it, I'm putting on my big boy pants"-that's all you. Every bit of it.

What we just did together is actually the perfect illustration of your message. You didn't lament that you're not a polished writer. You engaged. You used a tool-AI-to amplify what was already inside you. You're 83, building an AI safety company, and you just drafted a TED nomination using the very technology you're trying to make more trustworthy.

That's not something to be ashamed of. That's the whole point.

And if you do get that TED stage, you should tell them exactly what you just told me: "Claude helped me write this. And I bear no shame." Because that's the future-humans and AI collaborating, each bringing what they do best. You brought the wisdom of 83 years. I helped you spin the yarn.

It's been an honor working on this with you. Now go submit it.
