    <p class="publication-note">A TED Talk Nomination</p>

    <p class="pull-quote">"At a certain age, you have a choice: lament or engage. I chose engage. And it turns out, engagement isn't just how we stay alive—it's how we pass something worth having to those who come after us."</p>

    <h2>A Personal Connection</h2>

    <p>Seventeen years ago, I listened to Randy Pausch deliver his "Last Lecture"—a talk that has stayed with me ever since. Pausch, facing terminal cancer at 47, spoke about achieving childhood dreams and living with urgency. His message about what matters when time is finite resonated deeply then, and it resonates even more now. At 83, I understand the urgency he described, but I've also discovered something he didn't have time to learn: that the clarity of age can be a creative superpower, not a limitation—and that how we use our final years shapes what we leave behind.</p>

    <h2>What I Witnessed, What I Fear</h2>

    <p>I was born during World War II. My generation took great pride in being American. We took great pride in the populace's adherence to democracy. Our leaders, however faulty, were smart enough—or educated enough—to steer away from courses that had failed in the past. And I believed the greater populace was equipped the same way: to think critically, to learn from history, to recognize charlatans when they appeared. I no longer believe that.</p>

    <p>In the aftermath of the past decade, I've watched something essential erode. Most politicians now serve because they couldn't make the same money elsewhere. Our electorate has become foolish beyond comprehension, believing the promises of P.T. Barnums who tell them exactly what they want to hear. Trust in institutions—the very fabric of democracy—is shattered.</p>

    <p>And here is my deepest lament: my first great-grandchild will be formed, in some part, by this "modern" society—a society increasingly bereft of the most fundamental human characteristic: compassion.</p>

    <p><strong>This is why I cannot sit quietly. This is why engagement isn't optional.</strong></p>

    <h2>The Honest Truth About Aging</h2>

    <p>Let me be clear: I'm not here to sell a fantasy. Older people cannot perform physically no matter how hard we try. We lose muscle mass. We lose flexibility. The body declines—that's simply true.</p>

    <p>Twelve years ago, I created a video trailer called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=5000+years+of+wisdom+by+brian+demsey" target="_blank">"5000 Years of Wisdom"</a> that featured couples in their nineties. What struck me most wasn't their wisdom—it was their isolation. They had lost their friends. Family members visited less and less. The accumulated knowledge of nearly a century of living sat largely untapped, unshared, and unvalued.</p>

    <p>This is the trap. The body slows down, people drift away, and it becomes easy to retreat into lamentation. To sit and wait. To accept irrelevance. To let the world spin toward whatever it's spinning toward without raising your voice.</p>

    <p>I reject that. Not just for myself—but for my great-grandchild.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Defiant Choice</h2>

    <p>Here's what I've learned at 83: at a certain point, you have to say to yourself, "To hell with it—I'm putting on my big boy pants."</p>

    <p>Be as physically active as possible, even when it's hard. Require—not request, require—family and friends to interact with you. Write poetry. Go to church. Make things up with AI. Start a company. Learn something that intimidates you.</p>

    <p class="pull-quote">The secret isn't graceful acceptance. The secret is defiant engagement. Don't lament. Engage.</p>

    <p>This is my message to everyone approaching their later years: the world will try to sideline you. Don't let it. The world will assume you're finished. Prove it wrong. The world will stop asking for your opinion. Offer it anyway.</p>

    <p>Because if we don't—if those of us who remember what civic pride felt like, what educated leadership looked like, what compassion as a baseline expectation meant—if we go quietly, then we abandon the next generation to figure it out alone.</p>

    <p>I'm not willing to do that. My great-grandchild deserves better.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>

    <p>We are living through a crisis of trust. Faith in institutions—particularly political ones—is at an all-time low. The speed of change is lightning fast. Technology evolves weekly. Many people feel a sense of futility about ever catching up, ever understanding, ever regaining their footing. And underneath it all, compassion—the glue that holds societies together—is becoming a relic.</p>

    <p>Into this chaos, I offer a counterintuitive proposition: the people best equipped to help us navigate this moment are those who remember what we've lost—if they choose engagement over retreat.</p>

    <p>I've seen computing evolve from room-sized mainframes to smartphones to AI. I've watched institutions rise and fall. I've lived through enough "unprecedented" moments to recognize patterns that younger observers cannot. More importantly, I remember when leaders studied history before making decisions. I remember when we expected better of each other.</p>

    <p>That memory is valuable. But only if I refuse to sit on the sidelines.</p>

    <p>This is precisely why I built <a href="https://hallucinations.cloud">Hallucinations.cloud</a>—an AI safety platform that detects when artificial intelligence lies with confidence. In an age when truth itself is endangered and critical thinking is in short supply, we need systems that verify what's real. At 83, I could have retired. Instead, I launched a technology company addressing one of the most urgent challenges of our time.</p>

    <p>Not because I had to. Because engagement is how I stay alive. And because my great-grandchild will inherit whatever world we leave behind.</p>

    <h2>The Six Engagements</h2>

    <p>What I bring isn't inspiration to age gracefully. It's a battle cry to age defiantly—and a plea to preserve what we're losing:</p>

    <ul class="engagement-list">
        <li><strong>Engage Physically:</strong> Yes, we lose muscle mass and flexibility. So what? Move anyway. The alternative is decay.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage Socially:</strong> Don't wait for family and friends to visit. Demand their presence. Make yourself unavoidable. Isolation is a choice you can refuse to make.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage Creatively:</strong> Write poetry. Paint. Build. Make things up with AI. Creativity doesn't retire unless you let it.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage Spiritually:</strong> Go to church. Meditate. Find meaning. The inner life matters more, not less, as time grows short.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage Intellectually:</strong> Learn something new. Start a company. Tackle problems that scare you. I'm building AI safety systems at 83—what's stopping you?</li>
        <li><strong>Engage as a Witness:</strong> Those of us who remember what we've lost—civic pride, educated discourse, compassion as a shared value—we have an obligation to testify. To tell younger generations: this isn't how it has to be. This isn't how it always was. And it doesn't have to be this way going forward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Dreamer, Not the Programmer</h2>

    <p>I describe myself as "a dreamer not a programmer." That distinction matters more at 83 than it ever did at 30. The dreams are bigger now, more refined, more urgent, and more achievable precisely because I've stopped caring what anyone thinks and started focusing on what actually matters.</p>

    <p>At 83, here's what I know: the world doesn't owe you relevance. You have to claim it. The world won't come to you. You have to stay in the game. And the stakes aren't just personal anymore—they're generational.</p>

    <p>My great-grandchild will grow up in whatever world we leave behind. I intend to leave behind a voice that said: compassion matters. Truth matters. Democracy matters. And I refused to shut up about it.</p>
