    <p>From the 92nd Street "Y" in New York City

THE OPENING

William F. Buckley Jr. settles into his chair at center stage, that familiar aristocratic posture, the slight lean back, fingers steepled. He clicks his tongue-tsk-that peculiar metronome of contemplation that accompanied a thousand televised debates. His eyes scan the panel with an expression somewhere between amusement and concern.

To his left: James Baldwin, compact and intense, eyes that have seen too much and refuse to look away. Gore Vidal, languid and dangerous, already composing his first verbal strike. Edward R. Murrow, cigarette somehow present despite all regulations, the newsman's eternal prop. George Carlin, white-haired and impish, looking like he's about to expose everyone's pretensions.

To his right: Henry Kissinger, heavy with the weight of nations and secrets. Larry Bird, looking slightly uncomfortable in this company but utterly unbothered by it, like a man who's been booed by Boston fans and survived. Stephen Miller, young and certain, jaw set. And the mystery guest, features obscured but presence unmistakable-the elephant in the room wearing an unconvincing disguise.

Buckley clears his throat. The tongue-click again. Tsk-tsk.

"Gentlemen," he begins, drawing out the word with that patrician Connecticut drawl, "in my day-and I say this with full awareness of how that phrase ages me-Republicans stood for certain identifiable principles: fiscal responsibility, limited federal government, free markets, institutional respect, the notion that character mattered in public office, and a certain... decorum... in discourse."

He pauses, pen twirling between his fingers.

"Democrats, meanwhile, stood for the working man, for organized labor, for social programs, for civil rights-eventually-and for a robust federal government as the solution to collective problems. There was daylight between these positions. Clear daylight. And most American voters, regardless of their education or station, understood how their vote would make a material difference in their lives: taxes up or down, regulations more or less, social safety net expanded or contracted."

Another click of the tongue.

"Today, I confess I am... perplexed. What do these parties stand for now? What does the American voter understand about how their vote affects their daily existence? And more troubling still..." He lets his gaze drift across the panel, lingering for a moment on the disguised figure. "...how did we arrive at a moment where executive orders-meant to be the president's administrative housekeeping-have become the primary instrument of governance, issued by the dozens, the hundreds, to circumvent rather than complement legislative process?"

He leans back. "Gentlemen, I open the floor."

THE CONVERSATION BEGINS

Edward R. Murrow lights his cigarette, the ember glowing in the stage lights. His voice is measured, the broadcaster's trained instrument.

"Bill, you speak of clarity. Let me tell you about clarity. In my time, we had three networks. People watched the same news, heard the same facts, then argued about what those facts meant. That was healthy. We had gatekeepers-yes, imperfect, sometimes biased-but they understood that facts were facts. When I reported on McCarthy, I didn't say 'some people think he's dangerous.' I showed his own words, his own actions, and let viewers judge."

He exhales smoke.

"Today? We have infinite channels and zero shared reality. It's not that we disagree on what facts mean-we can't even agree on what facts are. 'Fake news' isn't a critique; it's a weapon. You simply declare any inconvenient truth to be false, and your audience believes you because they've been trained to trust nothing except what confirms what they already believe. How does a democracy function when we can't agree on basic observable reality?"

James Baldwin leans forward, his voice quiet but intense, the way a man speaks when he's said these things a thousand times and knows he'll need to say them a thousand more.

"Eddie speaks of shared reality. But let me ask: when was this golden age of shared facts? When I wrote The Fire Next Time, white America didn't want to hear the facts about what was happening in Birmingham, in Mississippi, in Harlem. The facts were there-lynchings, bombings, daily humiliations-but facts don't matter if people refuse to see them."

He pauses.

"Bill asks what parties stand for now. I'll tell you what they stood for then and what they stand for now: power. The question was always who gets power and who gets ground under its boot. Republicans gave us Southern Strategy-they decided winning meant abandoning any pretense of racial justice. Democrats gave us welfare reform and crime bills-they decided winning meant abandoning poor people. Both parties decided that working people didn't matter as much as corporate donors."

He looks directly at the mystery guest.

"And now we have this moment-executive orders used like royal decrees, not because it's effective governance but because it's visible governance. It's performance. Sign something on television, hold it up for the cameras, and your supporters believe you've done something even if it gets struck down in court a week later. It's not about policy. It's about theater."

Gore Vidal laughs, a sharp bark of aristocratic disdain.

"Jimmy, you're too kind. At least theater has artistic merit. This is professional wrestling. Buckley here wants to know what happened to his Republican Party-the party of Taft, of Eisenhower, of genteel conservatism. I'll tell you what happened: it died. It was murdered. By Nixon's paranoia, by Reagan's senility and voodoo economics, by the cynical decision that ignorance was easier to monetize than intelligence."

He gestures broadly.

"The Republican Party Bill built-intellectual conservatism, National Review, the Buckley style of debate-it was killed by its own success. You taught conservatives they were intellectually respectable. So they stopped being intellectual. Why read Burke when you can watch Fox News? Why engage in debate when you can just shout 'liberal media'? You built a mansion, Bill, and your heirs turned it into a casino."

Buckley clicks his tongue but remains composed. "Gore, your talent for vitriol remains undiminished by time."

"Thank you. I cultivate it like a rare orchid."

Henry Kissinger speaks, his accent still thick, his manner that of a man accustomed to being the smartest person in the room and unbothered by whether you like him for it.

"This nostalgia for clarity is misplaced. Politics was never clear; we simply had fewer cameras. Roosevelt issued 3,721 executive orders. Truman issued 907. I worked for Nixon-not a president known for restraint or respect for institutional norms. The question is not whether executive power is being used, but whether it is being used strategically and in service of coherent national interest."

He folds his hands.

"What troubles me is not the number of executive orders but their incoherence. An order issued Monday, reversed Wednesday, reissued Friday-this is not strategy. This is impulse. In foreign policy, we had doctrine: containment, d tente, mutual assured destruction. One could disagree with these doctrines, but they were doctrines-coherent frameworks. Now? Alliances treated as transactions. Treaties abandoned on whim. Enemies praised, allies insulted, all depending on morning mood. This is not realism. This is chaos pretending to be strength."

George Carlin has been waiting, that mischievous glint in his eye growing brighter.

"Oh, this is beautiful. This is beautiful. Henry Kissinger lecturing about coherent doctrine and institutional respect. Henry, you bombed Cambodia. Secretly. Without telling Congress. You helped overthrow Chile's democracy. You told Nixon the presidency was 'above the law' during Watergate. And now you're upset because somebody's being incoherent about it?"

He spreads his hands.

"Here's what I love about this conversation: everyone's acting shocked that the emperor has no clothes, when the emperor hasn't had clothes for fifty fucking years. We've just been pretending we couldn't see his dick. Executive orders? FDR used them to put Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Truman used them to seize steel mills. Every president has stretched executive power as far as it would go, and further. The only difference now is nobody's pretending it's constitutional anymore. We've dropped the act."

He leans back.

"Bill wants to know what parties stand for. I'll tell you: They stand for corporate money. That's it. That's the whole answer. Republicans and Democrats are like Coke and Pepsi-different flavors, same sugar water, same corporation owns both. They give you the illusion of choice while they pick your pocket. The only thing that's changed is one party stopped pretending to be polite about it."

Stephen Miller speaks for the first time, his voice controlled, purposeful.

"With respect to Mr. Carlin's cynicism, there is a difference. A fundamental difference. And it comes down to this: who decides? For decades-through both Republican and Democratic administrations-unelected bureaucrats, career government officials, and judges made policy. They regulated, litigated, and legislated from the bench while elected officials became managers of the administrative state rather than representatives of the people."

He sits forward.

"Executive orders are not a circumvention of democracy-they are a restoration of it. They represent the will of the elected executive against the permanent government. When the president signs an order on immigration, on regulation, on energy policy, he is enacting the mandate given by voters. If Congress disagrees, they can pass legislation. If courts disagree, they can rule. But the idea that a president should defer to bureaucratic 'norms' created by people who were never elected and can never be removed-that's not democracy. That's technocracy."

Larry Bird has been listening quietly, the way he used to watch opponents during warmups, taking their measure. Now he speaks, his Indiana accent flat and direct.

"Can I just say something? I don't know about executive orders or technocracy or whatever. But I know about performance. And I know about leadership. In basketball, you can talk all you want, but eventually you gotta perform. You gotta make the shot. You gotta make your teammates better. You gotta win."

He shrugs.

"All this talk about what parties used to stand for, what they stand for now-seems to me people are working harder than ever and getting less. They can't afford houses. Can't afford healthcare. Their kids are drowning in debt. And meanwhile, everyone in Washington is performing for cameras, signing papers, making speeches, but nothing's actually getting better for regular people."

He looks at the mystery guest.

"Caitlin Clark-she just plays. She's the best, and her performance proves it. She doesn't have to tell everyone she's great; you can see it in the results. Leadership is about making things better, not just looking like you're making things better. I don't care how many executive orders get signed if people still can't afford to live."

THE CLASH

Baldwin turns to Miller.

"You speak of 'the will of the elected executive' as if it's a mandate from heaven. But let me ask you directly: when that executive issues orders to separate children from their parents at the border, to ban Muslims from entering the country, to roll back protections for transgender children-is that restoring democracy or is that tyranny with a ballot box?"

Miller doesn't flinch.

"Those are policy choices. You can disagree with them. That's your right. But they're not tyranny-they're governance. Immigration policy, national security, state versus federal authority on social issues-these are legitimate areas of executive action. The fact that you disagree with the policy doesn't make it illegitimate."

Baldwin's voice rises slightly, still controlled but with steel underneath.

"Policy. You call cruelty policy. You call discrimination policy. This is what I mean about shared reality-you see orders, I see children crying for their parents. You see governance, I see generations of my people who were told their oppression was just 'policy.' Slavery was policy. Jim Crow was policy. Japanese internment was policy. Saying something is policy doesn't make it right. It just makes it organized."

Vidal interjects.

"Stephen represents something new in American politics-the intellectual bodyguard for anti-intellectualism. He's smart enough to construct sophisticated rationales for primitive impulses. It's quite an achievement, really. In my day, demagogues at least had the honesty to be stupid."

Murrow taps ash from his cigarette.

"The question isn't whether executive orders are legal tools-they are. The question is: what happens to democratic accountability when governance by executive order becomes the norm? When I can't follow the logic from campaign promise to legislative debate to enacted law, but instead wake up to find policy has changed overnight by decree-how do I as a citizen participate? How do I even know what the policy is if it changes weekly?"

Kissinger nods slowly.

"Edward makes the essential point. Governance requires predictability. Allies must know where we stand. Markets must know what rules apply. Citizens must know what to expect. This is not about ideology-it is about basic functionality. When policy becomes purely reactive, purely personal, purely theatrical..." He pauses. "...nations become ungovernable."

The Mystery Guest has been silent, but now shifts in his seat. Everyone notices. The energy in the room changes.

Buckley glances over, tongue clicking. Tsk. "Our guest seems... restless. Perhaps there's something you'd like to contribute to this discussion?"

The figure remains silent, but the body language speaks volumes-arms crossed, defensive posture, the attitude of someone who believes he's being ganged up on and who simultaneously doesn't care what any of these people think.

Carlin grins.

"Oh, I love this. The elephant in the room wearing a Groucho Marx disguise. Look, we all know who's sitting there. We all know what he represents. And the beautiful thing-the absolutely beautiful thing-is that he's the logical endpoint of everything everyone here has been complaining about."

He counts on his fingers.

"Bill, you wanted conservatism that ordinary people could understand-you got it, just without the intellectual part. Jimmy, you said both parties only care about power-well, here's someone who doesn't even pretend otherwise. Gore, you said politics became professional wrestling-say hello to Vince McMahon's biggest star. Eddie, you said we lost shared reality-here's a man who creates his own reality and demands everyone else live in it. Henry, you wanted strategic use of power-here's someone who treats everything like a transaction. Stephen, you wanted someone to fight the bureaucrats-congratulations. And Larry, you wanted someone who performs for results-well, you got someone who performs."

He spreads his hands.

"The question isn't how did we get him. The question is: what does it mean that we wanted him? Millions of people looked at this-" he gestures at the mystery guest "-and said 'Yes. That. More of that.' What does that tell us?"

ON EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND THE LAW

Buckley steers the conversation back.

"Let's discuss the specific mechanism, gentlemen. Executive orders. The Founders never mentioned them in the Constitution. They emerged as administrative necessity. But there's a difference between ordering federal offices to close for a holiday and attempting to redirect congressional appropriations, or declaring national emergencies to circumvent legislative denial of funding."

He looks at Kissinger.

"Henry, in your time, how many executive orders were issued not as administration but as policy substitution?"

Kissinger considers.

"We used executive privilege-different instrument, same principle-to conduct foreign policy beyond congressional oversight. Was it legal? Debatable. Was it necessary? We believed so. But we understood there were limits. When those limits were crossed-Watergate, impoundment-the system corrected. Slowly, painfully, but it corrected."

Murrow adds.

"And critically, there was investigative pressure. Congress investigated. Courts ruled. Press reported. The corrective mechanisms functioned. Today, when an order is struck down by courts, it's simply reissued with minor changes. When Congress investigates, it's called a 'witch hunt.' When press reports, it's called 'fake news.' The corrective mechanisms are under attack."

Miller responds.

"The corrective mechanisms became obstruction mechanisms. Activist judges issuing nationwide injunctions from district courts. Career officials leaking to friendly press to undermine elected leadership. Congressional investigations as political theater rather than oversight. These aren't checks and balances-they're vetoes by unelected actors."

Baldwin shakes his head.

"You're describing accountability as if it's oppression. When judges rule against executive overreach, that's not activism-that's their job. When officials leak illegal activity, that's not betrayal-that's whistleblowing. When Congress investigates, that's not theater-that's the Constitution. You want a king, not a president."

Bird speaks up again.

"I keep hearing about checks and balances, activist judges, all this inside baseball. But here's what I see: Nothing gets done. Both parties blame each other. Presidents sign orders. Courts block them. Everyone shouts. Meanwhile, regular people are still struggling."

He looks around the panel.

"Maybe executive orders become necessary when Congress stops functioning. Maybe the system's broken from top to bottom, and everyone's just trying to work around it. But working around something broken doesn't fix it. It just makes it more broken."

Vidal perks up.

"The farmer from Indiana makes more sense than any of you. The system is broken. It's been broken since the Kennedy assassination-forgive me, since the Kennedy assignations. We haven't had a functional republic in decades. We have political theater company, corporate feudalism, and occasionally, when the masses get restless, we let them choose between two carefully vetted representatives of capital."

He lights a cigarette.

"Executive orders are symptoms, not the disease. The disease is that Congress is purchased, courts are partisan, press is entertainment, and citizens are consumers. You can't fix symptoms without treating the disease."

Carlin jumps in.

"And nobody wants to treat the disease because everyone's making money off it! That's the part that kills me. You're all sitting here pretending this is about principles-conservative versus liberal, order versus chaos, democracy versus tyranny. It's not. It's about whether you're getting your cut."

He points at different panelists.

"Corporate tax cuts? Executive order. Immigration crackdown? Executive order. Environmental deregulation? Executive order. Student loan forgiveness? Executive order. Each side uses the same tool for opposite purposes, and both sides scream 'tyranny' when the other team is up to bat. It's not about the rule of law. It's about whose law is being ruled."

LOOKING BACKWARD, LOOKING FORWARD

Buckley clicks his tongue again, that familiar punctuation.

"Perhaps we should examine specific numbers. Mr. Murrow mentioned predictability. Let's be specific. Franklin Roosevelt: 3,721 executive orders over twelve years-unconstitutional concentration camps included. Truman: 907 orders. Eisenhower: 484. Kennedy: 214. Johnson: 325. Nixon: 346. My God, even Nixon showed restraint compared to Roosevelt."

He consults notes.

"Then something interesting: Ford: 169. Carter: 320. Reagan: 381. Bush Sr.: 166. Clinton: 364. Bush Jr.: 291. Obama: 276. Trump: 220 in four years. Biden: on pace for similar numbers."

He looks up.

"The raw numbers decline over time, yet the impact of each order seems to grow. Why? Because they've shifted from administrative housekeeping-setting pay scales for federal employees, creating commemorative medals-to substantive policy: healthcare mandates, immigration enforcement priorities, environmental regulations, student debt forgiveness."

Kissinger nods.

"The nature has changed more than the quantity. An executive order that creates a new medal costs nothing and affects few. An order that redirects billions in appropriations or alters the legal status of millions-this is legislation without legislation."

Murrow exhales smoke.

"And the flaunting of judicial review. When a president issues an order, it's blocked by courts, then simply reissued with cosmetic changes, blocked again, reissued again-this isn't respect for legal process. This is gamesmanship. The goal isn't policy; it's headlines. 'President Signs Order' plays better than 'President Negotiates with Congress.'"

The Mystery Guest shifts again, clearly agitated by this characterization. Arms still crossed. Silent but present.

Baldwin addresses the silent figure directly.

"You don't have to speak. We know what you're thinking. 'I won. I have a mandate. I'm keeping promises. They're just upset because they lost.' And you know what? Partly true. You did win. You do represent millions of people. But here's what you don't seem to understand: winning doesn't make you right. Popularity doesn't equal morality. And power without restraint isn't strength-it's danger."

He leans forward.

"Every authoritarian in history believed he represented the people's will. Every tyrant thought he was the solution. And you know what they all had in common? They hated limits. They hated being told 'no.' They saw checks and balances as obstacles rather than protections."

Miller bristles.

"Comparing elected American presidents to authoritarians is exactly the hysteria that discredits your position. Nobody's abolished Congress. Nobody's suspended elections. Courts still rule. Press still publishes. The system functions."

Baldwin doesn't back down.

"The system functions until it doesn't. Democracy dies slowly, then all at once. It dies when leaders attack the legitimacy of elections they lose. It dies when crowds are encouraged to storm the Capitol. It dies when truth becomes negotiable and violence becomes acceptable. Don't tell me the system functions when I can see it straining at every joint."

Bird interrupts.

"Okay, but here's what I don't get. You're all talking about system and democracy and institutions. But what about people? What about the guy working two jobs who can't pay rent? What about the woman choosing between medicine and groceries? What about kids graduating with $100,000 in debt?"

He looks frustrated.

"Maybe people voted for..." he gestures at the mystery guest, "...that, because they're desperate. Because the system you're all defending stopped working for them twenty years ago. Maybe executive orders are popular because at least something's happening, even if it's wrong, instead of nothing happening while everyone follows proper procedure."

Vidal actually applauds.

"Bravo, Mr. Bird. You've identified the crisis: legitimacy. The system lost legitimacy for millions because it stopped delivering. When people have jobs but can't afford to live, when they play by the rules but fall further behind, when they watch bankers get bailouts while they lose homes-they stop believing in the system. And when they stop believing, they become vulnerable to anyone who promises to break it."

Carlin grins wider.

"And that's where we are, folks. The system's broke. Everybody knows it. One side says 'let's fix the system.' The other side says 'fuck the system.' And regular people, they don't care about the difference because neither side is actually fixing anything. They just care that their kids are worse off than they were, and their grandkids are fucked."

CLOSING SPEECHES: ON AMERICAN ANXIETY AND THE PATH FORWARD

Buckley straightens in his chair, composing himself for the conclusion.

"Gentlemen, we've diagnosed much and solved little-rather typical of intellectual gatherings, I'm afraid. But let us attempt something constructive. Each of you will offer a closing statement: What is the root cause of our current American anxiety, and what path forward can you envision? Mr. Murrow, as the elder newsman, please begin."

Edward R. Murrow stubs out his cigarette and looks directly at the audience, as he always did, speaking to people rather than performing for them.

"The root cause is the death of shared truth. Not shared opinion-we've never had that, never needed it. But shared facts. When I reported from London during the Blitz, Americans heard the bombs and knew they were real. When I exposed McCarthy, we showed his own words and people could judge. We had a foundation of observable reality on which to build our disagreements.

That foundation has crumbled. Not because facts changed, but because trust collapsed. We stopped trusting institutions-some of that distrust earned, much of it manufactured. We retreated into tribal epistemologies where truth is whatever your team says it is. And into that vacuum rushed something worse than lies: the assertion that truth itself is just another power game.

The path forward? We must rebuild the institutions that verify truth. Not perfectly-they never were perfect-but functionally. Independent journalism funded by readers, not clicks. Courts respected even when they rule against your side. Scientists heard even when inconvenient. Elections accepted even when you lose.

This isn't nostalgia. It's survival. Democracy cannot function when citizens inhabit separate realities. You can't compromise with someone when you can't even agree on what's happening. The work ahead isn't political-it's epistemological. We must relearn how to know what's true. Good night, and good luck."

James Baldwin speaks quietly, as always, but with an intensity that fills the room.

"The root cause is the same root cause it's always been in America: we have never, ever been honest about who we are. We have never reckoned with our original sins. We built a nation on stolen land using stolen labor and called it freedom. We wrote 'all men are created equal' while holding human beings in chains. We promised equality under law while lynching Black bodies with impunity.

And we never dealt with it. We papered over it, we compromised with it, we pretended time would heal it. But wounds don't heal when you won't look at them. They fester. They poison the body. And now that poison is killing us.

The anxiety you feel isn't new. Black people have felt this anxiety for four hundred years-the anxiety of knowing the system is rigged, that the rules don't apply equally, that violence can come at any moment and the law won't protect you. Now more Americans are feeling that anxiety, and they're shocked by it. Welcome to the neighborhood.

The path forward requires something white America has never been willing to do: tell the truth. The whole truth. About slavery and what came after. About how wealth was built on our backs and stolen from our hands. About how the law was written to protect some and control others. About how institutions were designed to preserve power, not distribute it.

Until we do that-until we actually, finally, painfully tell the truth about America-we will keep having this same conversation. We will keep wondering why we're anxious, why we're divided, why nothing works. The house is built on sand, and we keep arguing about the furniture arrangement instead of the foundation.

You want to know the path forward? Stop lying. Start there. Just stop lying. Tell the truth about where we've been. Then maybe, maybe, we can talk about where we're going."

Gore Vidal leans back, languid and sharp as ever.

"The root cause is that we're a bankrupt empire pretending to be a functioning republic. Every empire declines the same way: military overextension, fiscal irresponsibility, political corruption, bread and circuses for the masses. We've checked every box. We spend more on military than the next ten nations combined while our infrastructure crumbles. We cut taxes for the wealthy while debt explodes. Congress is purchased by corporations. And we watch reality television instead of reading.

The American Century ended sometime around 2003 in the sands of Iraq, but nobody wants to admit it. So we keep performing greatness while the foundation rots. We elect celebrities instead of statesmen. We wage culture wars instead of addressing structural collapse. We argue about pronouns while the planet burns and the wealth gap becomes a chasm.

The path forward? There isn't one. Not the one you want to hear, anyway. Empires don't reform-they fall. Rome didn't become a better republic; it became an authoritarian state, then collapsed. Britain didn't revive its empire; it managed its decline with some grace. We'll do neither. We'll rage against the dying of the light, elect increasingly demagogic leaders who promise to restore lost glory, and eventually fragment or transform into something unrecognizable.

If you want a cheerful path forward, ask someone else. I deal in history, and history is clear: we're in the decline phase. The only question is whether we manage it intelligently or burn it all down. Current trajectory suggests the latter. But perhaps I'll be proven wrong. I'd enjoy that, actually. Though I doubt I'll live to see it."

Henry Kissinger folds his hands, every inch the realist.

"The root cause is the collapse of strategic thinking. Nations, like individuals, require two things to function: the ability to assess reality accurately, and the capacity to plan beyond immediate gratification. America has lost both.

We assess reality through ideological lenses rather than objective analysis. We see what we wish to see, ignore what contradicts our preferences. This is fatal in foreign policy and domestic policy alike. When China assesses America, they see accurately. When America assesses China, we project our values onto them and wonder why they don't behave as we expect. The same with Russia, Iran, our own citizens.

We plan in two-year election cycles. Infrastructure requires decades. Climate requires centuries. Great power competition requires generational strategies. But we cannot even pass a budget without crisis. How do you compete with nations that plan in fifty-year increments when you plan in news cycles?

The path forward requires a return to realism. Not idealism-idealism is a luxury of the secure. Realism. Accurate assessment of threats and capabilities. Long-term strategic planning regardless of which party holds power. Recognition that international order requires maintenance, not just rhetoric. And domestically, the courage to make hard choices that benefit the future at the expense of the present.

This will not be popular. Realism never is. People want to hear they can have everything-security without cost, prosperity without work, power without responsibility. But reality doesn't negotiate. You can ignore reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. The path forward is accepting that adults must make adult choices, and soon, before children make them for us."

George Carlin grins, that familiar mischievous energy.

"The root cause? We're fucking stupid. I don't mean uneducated-I mean willfully, aggressively, proudly stupid. We've turned ignorance into a virtue and intelligence into elitism. We believe whatever makes us feel good and reject whatever challenges us. We've got the attention span of a goldfish and the curiosity of a stone.

And you know what? It's by design. The owners of this country-the real owners, not the puppets we elect-they want us stupid. Stupid people make obedient workers. Stupid people don't ask questions. Stupid people buy things they don't need with money they don't have. Stupid people vote against their own interests because they've been convinced the enemy is other poor people, not the rich people picking their pockets.

We've replaced education with training. We've replaced thinking with reacting. We've replaced conversation with shouting. We've turned everything into entertainment, including our own destruction. It's all a show, folks. Politics is a show. News is a show. Even this-" he gestures around "-is a show. And we're sitting here performing our roles: the intellectual, the activist, the cynic, the villain, pretending our words matter while the owners laugh and count their money.

The path forward? There isn't one. Not collectively. The collective is fucked. But individually? Turn off your TV. Stop consuming garbage. Read a fucking book. Think for yourself. Question everything, especially what you want to believe. Connect with real people in real places. Do something that matters to someone who matters to you.

The system's going to collapse. Might take ten years, might take fifty, but it's going down. So don't waste your time trying to save it. Build something small and real and true. Help your neighbor. Grow some food. Make something beautiful. Laugh at the absurdity. And when it all falls apart-which it will-you'll have something real to stand on instead of the shifting sands of bullshit we call civilization.

In the meantime, enjoy the show. It's going to be spectacular."

Stephen Miller sits forward, controlled and certain.

"The root cause is that we forgot we're a nation. Not an idea. Not a collection of diverse peoples. Not a global experiment. A nation. With borders, sovereignty, shared culture, common language, and mutual obligations.

For decades, both parties told us that nationhood was outdated, that we were 'citizens of the world,' that borders were arbitrary lines, that American culture was whatever anyone wanted it to be. They told us that caring about your own country, your own people, your own culture was somehow bigoted. That putting your nation first was nationalism in the bad sense.

And what happened? We became strangers to each other. We imported millions of people with no requirement that they integrate. We shipped jobs overseas with no concern for displaced workers. We fought wars for other nations while our own infrastructure crumbled. We prioritized global markets over American workers. We became a nation of diverse groups competing for resources rather than a unified people working toward common goals.

The anxiety Americans feel is the anxiety of dissolution. They see their communities transformed beyond recognition. They see their children taught to be ashamed of their country. They see their concerns dismissed as bigotry. They see their nation disappearing, and they're told they're not allowed to fight for it.

The path forward is simple: reassert nationhood. Control our borders. Prioritize American workers. Require integration. Teach pride in American achievement, not endless focus on American sins. Build a shared culture rather than celebrating division. Put America first-not in a belligerent way, but in the obvious way that every successful nation does.

This isn't controversial in any other country. Japan puts Japan first. Israel puts Israel first. China puts China first. But America is told that caring about America is somehow wrong. It's not. It's necessary. And it's the only path to reducing anxiety and restoring unity. You cannot have a nation of people with nothing in common except geography. You need shared identity. Shared purpose. Shared future.

That's the path forward: remembering we're Americans first, and everything else second."

Larry Bird looks uncomfortable being asked for a speech, but speaks plainly.

"I'm not a speechmaker. I'm a basketball player. But I'll tell you what I see.

The root cause is people stopped working together. In basketball, you can have five talented individuals, but if they don't play as a team, they lose. I played with guys I didn't always like, but we respected each other's game and we worked toward the same goal: winning. We made each other better.

Right now in America, everyone's playing for themselves. Everyone's trying to be the star. Everyone's worried about their stats and their brand and their Twitter followers. Nobody's setting screens for their teammates. Nobody's playing defense. Nobody's making the extra pass. Everyone wants to take the last shot, but nobody wants to do the dirty work that wins games.

And the people suffering are regular people-people who just want to work hard, take care of their families, and have a decent life. They don't care about all this political stuff. They just want their job to pay enough that they can afford rent. They want their kids to get educated without going broke. They want to be able to get sick without losing everything.

The path forward? People need to start acting like teammates instead of opponents. Stop trying to make each other look bad and start trying to make each other better. Help people instead of judging them. Listen to people instead of shouting at them. And for God's sake, actually do something useful instead of just performing for cameras.

In basketball, we had one goal: win. In America, what's the goal? Seems like everyone's playing a different game. Until we figure out what we're actually trying to accomplish together, we're going to keep losing. That's all I got."

Buckley turns to the mystery guest.

"And you, sir? You've sat silently through these proceedings. Would you care to offer your perspective on the root cause of American anxiety and the path forward?"

The figure remains motionless for a long moment. Then, slowly, deliberately, he crosses his arms tighter and shakes his head once. No.

Buckley clicks his tongue. Tsk. "A closing speech delivered through silence. How... unprecedented. Very well."

He turns to the audience.

"Gentlemen, thank you. We've heard diagnoses ranging from epistemological crisis to imperial decline, from racial reckoning to civilizational stupidity, from lost nationhood to absent teamwork. These are not reconcilable positions. Perhaps that itself is the diagnosis.

The path forward-if there is one-will not emerge from consensus. It never has. It will emerge from the grinding conflict of these irreconcilable positions, from the messy, frustrating, infuriating process of democracy. Or it won't emerge at all, and Mr. Vidal will be proven correct about empires and their inevitable decline.

Either way, the conversation continues. It must. Because the alternative to conversation-however heated, however frustrated, however unresolved-is something none of us should wish to contemplate."

EPILOGUE

As the panel rises, the mystery guest stands abruptly and exits without acknowledging anyone. Miller follows quickly. Kissinger moves slowly toward the exit, Murrow beside him, still smoking. Baldwin and Vidal exchange barbs that might be insults or might be affection-with them, it's always both. Carlin is already planning his next routine. Bird just wants to get back to his hotel.

Buckley remains on stage, pen twirling, tongue clicking one final time. Tsk.

He looks at the empty chair where the mystery guest sat.

"I built a conservatism of ideas," he says to no one in particular. "And it was inherited by someone who has only instincts. Perhaps that's how all intellectual movements end-consumed by their own popular success."

He exits stage left, the sound of his footsteps echoing in the empty hall.

The conversation is over.

The anxiety remains.
