    <p>The Opening from the 92nd Street "Y" in New York City

A moderator introduces the panel. Lebowitz immediately complains about the uncomfortable chair and asks if anyone has a cigarette, even though you can't smoke there. Swift sits up straight, prepared and gracious. Kardashian is checking her phone. RBG has her reading glasses on, reviewing notes. Rivers would already be making jokes about everyone. Roosevelt remains poised. Stein might say something cryptic like "A panel is a panel is a panel." Kilgallen is sizing everyone up like a detective.

On Fame and Public Life

Moderator: "What does it mean to be a public woman?"

Roosevelt: "It's a responsibility. You have a platform, you must use it for good."

Lebowitz: "It's a nightmare. Everyone thinks they deserve your attention. I became famous for complaining about exactly this."

Swift: "I think it's about connection-reaching people through art and using that connection to make change."

Kardashian: "It's about building something. I built businesses, I'm studying law, I'm helping people get out of prison."

Rivers: "It's about survival, honey. They want you young, they want you pretty, they want you quiet. I said 'screw that' and kept talking."

RBG: "It's about doing the work. The recognition is secondary to the jurisprudence."
Stein: "The public is there there, but the work is here."

Kilgallen: "It's about asking the questions no one else will ask."

On Being Underestimated

Rivers: "They said a woman couldn't host late night. So I did it. Then they punished me for it. But I survived."

RBG: "I was asked at Cornell how it felt to take a spot that could have gone to a man. I said I was here to learn."

Kardashian: "Everyone thought I was just famous for nothing. Now I'm taking the bar exam. Surprise."

Lebowitz (rolling her eyes): "Everyone underestimates everyone. That's what people do. They're stupid."

Swift: "They keep trying to diminish what I've built, calling it manufactured or saying I didn't write my own songs. So I just keep the receipts."

Roosevelt: "They said the First Lady should serve tea and smile. I held press conferences for women journalists only and wrote a daily newspaper column."

On New York City

Lebowitz: "New York is over. It's been over since 1975. Now it's just a mall for rich people."

Rivers: "I've been hearing 'New York is over' my whole life. It's never over. It just gets more expensive and more neurotic, which is perfect for comedy."

Roosevelt: "I lived at Washington Square. The city taught me that democracy requires proximity to different people and ideas."

Kilgallen: "The city is where the stories are. The gossip, the crime, the secrets-it's all here."

Swift: "I wrote about New York as this magical place. I know that's naive, but that dream of New York matters too."

Kardashian: "I'm more of an LA girl, honestly."

Lebowitz: "Obviously."

On Art and Commerce

Stein: "Art is what we do. Commerce is what happens afterward, if at all."

Swift: "But why shouldn't artists get paid? I fought Spotify, I'm re-recording my albums. Art has value, literally."

Lebowitz: "Everyone wants to be paid now. Used to be you made art because you had to. Now everyone's a brand."

Kardashian: "What's wrong with being a brand? I employ people, build businesses. That's creative too."

Rivers: "Look, I did QVC. I sold jewelry. You know why? Because Johnny Carson blacklisted me and I had bills to pay. Commerce kept me alive to do the art."

RBG: "The law protects both artistic expression and commercial rights. They're not mutually exclusive."

Roosevelt: "But we must ask: does the work serve only ourselves, or does it serve the greater good?"

On Speaking Your Mind

Kilgallen: "I asked questions about the Kennedy assassination that made powerful people uncomfortable. That's the job."

Lebowitz: "I say what I think. People hate it. I don't care. Caring what people think is a full-time job, and I already have one."

Rivers: "Comedy is telling the truth. If they're not a little offended, you're not doing it right."

Swift: "I stayed quiet politically for years because I was afraid. Then I realized silence was a choice too, and not a neutral one."

Kardashian: "Social media changed everything. You can speak directly now, without filters. But everyone has an opinion about everything you say."

RBG: "I learned to speak carefully but firmly. 'I dissent' became more powerful because I used it strategically."
Roosevelt: "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to speak despite it."

Stein: "Words are words. Make them new."

The Clash

Lebowitz (to Swift and Kardashian): "Do either of you ever read books?"

Swift: "Of course! I reference literature in my songs all the time-'The Great Gatsby,' Emily Dickinson..."

Kardashian: "I'm reading law books right now, actually. Constitutional law, criminal procedure..."

Lebowitz: "I mean real books. For pleasure. Without posting about it."

Rivers: "Oh please, Fran. Not everyone needs to be a public intellectual. Some of us just entertain people and make millions. It's honest work."

Roosevelt: "I think we should celebrate all forms of contribution. Miss Swift reaches millions of young people. 

Miss Kardashian is learning law to help the incarcerated. These are valuable pursuits."

RBG: "Indeed. I was underestimated too. We all were. Perhaps we should extend the same benefit of the doubt we wish we'd received."

Stein: "A contribution is a contribution is a contribution."

Kilgallen: "Can we get back to the gossip? Who here has dated someone scandalous?"
Everyone looks at everyone else

Rivers: "Oh honey, we're all scandalous. That's why we're interesting."

Closing Speeches: On American Anxiety

The moderator asks for closing comments.
________________________________________
Eleanor Roosevelt (speaking first, as the eldest stateswoman)

"My friends, I have lived through two world wars, a Great Depression, and the constant struggle for civil rights. What I see today is not new anxiety-it is the ancient fear that we are losing control of our destiny. But the root cause? It is the abandonment of our responsibility to one another. We have replaced citizenship with consumerism, community with isolation. We doom-scroll instead of door-knock. 

We have forgotten that democracy is not a spectator sport-it requires our active participation, our willingness to sit with discomfort, to talk to those we disagree with. The anxiety you feel is the anxiety of having enormous power-the power to vote, to speak, to organize-and not using it. You are anxious because you know, deep down, that you are capable of more than you are doing. The answer is not to retreat into fear, but to advance into action. Do one thing every day that scares you-and make sure some of those things involve helping someone else."
________________________________________
Gertrude Stein

"The anxiety is the anxiety is the anxiety. You think it is new but it is old, you think it is American but it is human. The root? You have lost the ability to sit with yourselves. There is no there there because you are never there-you are always somewhere else, in your devices, in your feeds, in your manufactured realities. In Paris, we sat for hours and talked and argued and created. Now you scroll and scroll and call it living. 

You are anxious because you have replaced experience with performance, replaced being with seeming. A rose is a rose is a rose-but you photograph the rose, filter the rose, post the rose, and never actually smell the rose. The root cause is your refusal to be present in your own life. Stop performing. Start being. The anxiety will remain but it will be honest anxiety, which is the only kind worth having."
________________________________________
Dorothy Kilgallen

"I spent my career asking questions nobody wanted asked, investigating stories everyone said to leave alone. And I'll tell you what I see now: the root cause of this anxiety is that nobody trusts anything anymore-and they're right not to. 

We've been lied to by institutions, by media, by leaders. But here's the thing: instead of doing the hard work of investigation, of separating truth from fiction, people have given up entirely. They retreat into their chosen echo chambers and call it research. The anxiety comes from knowing, somewhere in your gut, that you're not actually informed-you're just reinforced. You want to know the truth? Turn off the TV, put down your phone, and start asking questions.

Real questions. Talk to your neighbors. Read primary sources. Do the work. The truth is still out there, but you have to be willing to chase it down like a reporter on deadline. And you won't like all of what you find-but at least you'll know it's real."
________________________________________
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

"The root cause of our anxiety is the erosion of institutional legitimacy and the rule of law. When people lose faith that the system will protect them fairly, when they see justice applied unequally, when they watch rights being stripped away that they thought were settled-anxiety is the rational response. But I would argue something more: we are anxious because we have become impatient with the slow work of progress.

Real change is incremental. It is one case, one law, one vote at a time. It requires persistence, not just passion. The anxiety many feel stems from wanting transformation overnight when the Constitution was designed for deliberation. 

My prescription? Fight for change within the system while respecting its structures. Dissent loudly but work methodically. Support institutions while demanding they do better. And remember: rights are not granted once and forever-they must be defended in every generation. Your anxiety is a call to action, not paralysis. So act-but act with strategy, with law, with the long game in mind."
________________________________________
Joan Rivers

"Alright, you want to know the root cause? You're all too damn serious. You've lost your sense of humor, and that's killing you.

Everyone is so offended by everything, so worried about saying the wrong thing, so busy performing outrage that nobody's actually living anymore. Look, I lived through real hardship-blacklisted, husband's suicide, starting over at fifty. You know what saved me? Laughing at the absurdity of it all. The root cause of your anxiety is that you've made life into this sacred, serious thing where one wrong move ends your career, your relationships, your reputation. 

Newsflash: life is ridiculous! Politics is ridiculous! You're going to die anyway! So you might as well laugh while you're here. Stop taking everything so personally. Stop thinking your feelings are legislation. And for God's sake, learn to laugh at yourself. The anxiety lifts when you realize that most of what you're worried about doesn't actually matter. 

What matters? Survival. Love. Work. And finding something to laugh about even when everything's falling apart. Can we talk?"
________________________________________
Fran Lebowitz

"The root cause is simple: you're all stupid now. I don't mean you lack intelligence-I mean you've stopped using it. You've outsourced your thinking to algorithms, your opinions to influencers, your attention span to whatever app some twenty-two-year-old billionaire designed to addict you. You're anxious because you know, somewhere in what's left of your consciousness, that you're not actually thinking anymore-you're reacting. 

The problem is technology. Not as a tool-as a replacement for human experience. You don't read anymore. You don't walk around the city observing things. You don't have long dinners with interesting people where you argue about ideas. You sit alone in your apartment, staring at a screen, watching other people live, comparing yourself to fantasies, and wondering why you're miserable. 

The root cause? You've lost the ability to be bored. And boredom is where thinking happens. You're anxious because your brain is screaming for something real-a real book, a real conversation, a real city that you actually walk through. But instead you scroll. My prescription? Read a book. A long one. Take a walk without your phone. Have an actual conversation. Be bored for five minutes. Your anxiety is your brain begging you to use it again."
________________________________________
Taylor Swift

"I think the root cause is that we're more connected than ever but lonelier than ever. We've built these incredible tools to reach each other, but somehow we're all isolated in our own realities. And there's this pressure-especially on young people-to have everything figured out, to have a perfect life, to never make mistakes, because everything is permanent now. 

Everything is recorded. Every mistake lives forever online. People are anxious because they're performing their lives instead of living them, and they know it's not sustainable but they don't know how to stop. The comparison culture is destroying us. Everyone looks at everyone else's highlight reel and thinks they're failing. And the algorithm is designed to show you what makes you angry or scared because that's what keeps you scrolling. 

I've felt this anxiety too-the pressure to be perfect, to please everyone, to never slip up. What I've learned is that you have to set boundaries. You have to protect your real life from your online life. You have to remember that your worth isn't measured in likes or followers or public opinion.

The root cause is that we've let technology corporations monetize our attention and our anxiety, and we've forgotten that we can just... log off. We can choose real connection over digital performance. That's what I'm trying to do, anyway."
________________________________________
Kim Kardashian

"Okay, look-everyone wants to blame social media, blame technology, blame phones. But I built my career on social media, and I'm not anxious about it. 

You want to know the real root cause? Inequality. People are anxious because the system is rigged. They're working harder than ever and getting nowhere. They can't afford homes, can't afford healthcare, can't afford education. 

They see billionaires launching rockets while they're drowning in student debt. And yeah, I'm wealthy-I know that. But I also know what it's like to hustle, to work every day, to build something. 

And I see the system now from the inside, especially working on criminal justice reform. People are anxious because they know the game is fixed. Poor people go to prison for decades for non-violent crimes while wealthy people get away with everything. 

The justice system is broken. The economic system is broken. And people know it. They feel it every day. So they're anxious because they're working as hard as they can and the system is designed to keep them down. 

My prescription? Use your platform, whatever it is, to change the system. I'm using mine to help people get out of prison, to reform sentencing laws. Everyone has some kind of power-use it to make things fairer. Because until the system is more just, until people can actually get ahead through hard work, the anxiety isn't going away."
________________________________________

The moderator thanks them all. The audience sits in silence for a moment, processing eight different diagnoses of the same American malaise: civic disengagement, absence of presence, institutional distrust, impatience with progress, loss of humor, intellectual laziness, digital performance, and systemic inequality.
Perhaps they're all right.

The moderator concludes with five thoughts capturing the essence of these remarkable women:

1. Democracy dies not in darkness but in the lazy comfort of the couch, where citizens scroll through outrage instead of organizing it into action, mistaking the performance of opinion for the practice of citizenship.

2. A life lived entirely for an audience-curated, filtered, and monetized-is not a life at all, but a frantic performance where the actor has forgotten there was ever supposed to be a person beneath the role.

3. Justice moves with the maddening pace of glaciers, not because it is weak but because it must be permanent, and those who demand revolution by morning will find themselves exhausted by noon while those who plant seeds wait patiently for forests.

4. The truth still exists but requires the dying art of investigation-real questions, primary sources, uncomfortable conversations-not the lazy tribalism of choosing which liar to believe based on which lies feel most comfortable.

The evening would end with grudging respect, a few genuine laughs, and Lebowitz complaining about having to take the subway home. Roosevelt would shake everyone's hand. RBG would nod approvingly. Rivers would already be writing material about the whole thing. Swift would post a thoughtful Instagram. Kardashian would post a selfie. Stein would say something incomprehensible that somehow makes perfect sense. And Kilgallen would be taking notes for her column.

The real magic? Watching women from different eras-from the Modernist 1920s to the social media 2020s-realize they've all fought the same battles in different costumes.

So act-but act with strategy, with law, with the long game in mind."

"Alright, you want to know the root cause? You're all too damn serious. You've lost your sense of humor, and that's killing you.

Everyone is so offended by everything, so worried about saying the wrong thing, so busy performing outrage that nobody's actually living anymore. Look, I lived through real hardship-blacklisted, husband's suicide, starting over at fifty. You know what saved me? Laughing at the absurdity of it all. The root cause of your anxiety is that you've made life into this sacred, serious thing where one wrong move ends your career, your relationships, your reputation. 

Newsflash: life is ridiculous! Politics is ridiculous! You're going to die anyway! So you might as well laugh while you're here. Stop taking everything so personally. Stop thinking your feelings are legislation. And for God's sake, learn to laugh at yourself. The anxiety lifts when you realize that most of what you're worried about doesn't actually matter. 

What matters? Survival. Love. Work. And finding something to laugh about even when everything's falling apart. Can we talk?"

"The root cause is simple: you're all stupid now. I don't mean you lack intelligence-I mean you've stopped using it. You've outsourced your thinking to algorithms, your opinions to influencers, your attention span to whatever app some twenty-two-year-old billionaire designed to addict you. You're anxious because you know, somewhere in what's left of your consciousness, that you're not actually thinking anymore-you're reacting. 

The problem is technology. Not as a tool-as a replacement for human experience. You don't read anymore. You don't walk around the city observing things. You don't have long dinners with interesting people where you argue about ideas. You sit alone in your apartment, staring at a screen, watching other people live, comparing yourself to fantasies, and wondering why you're miserable. 

The root cause? You've lost the ability to be bored. And boredom is where thinking happens. You're anxious because your brain is screaming for something real-a real book, a real conversation, a real city that you actually walk through. But instead you scroll. My prescription? Read a book. A long one. Take a walk without your phone. Have an actual conversation. Be bored for five minutes. Your anxiety is your brain begging you to use it again."

"I think the root cause is that we're more connected than ever but lonelier than ever. We've built these incredible tools to reach each other, but somehow we're all isolated in our own realities. And there's this pressure-especially on young people-to have everything figured out, to have a perfect life, to never make mistakes, because everything is permanent now. 

Everything is recorded. Every mistake lives forever online. People are anxious because they're performing their lives instead of living them, and they know it's not sustainable but they don't know how to stop. The comparison culture is destroying us. Everyone looks at everyone else's highlight reel and thinks they're failing. And the algorithm is designed to show you what makes you angry or scared because that's what keeps you scrolling. 

I've felt this anxiety too-the pressure to be perfect, to please everyone, to never slip up. What I've learned is that you have to set boundaries. You have to protect your real life from your online life. You have to remember that your worth isn't measured in likes or followers or public opinion.

The root cause is that we've let technology corporations monetize our attention and our anxiety, and we've forgotten that we can just... log off. We can choose real connection over digital performance. That's what I'm trying to do, anyway."

"Okay, look-everyone wants to blame social media, blame technology, blame phones. But I built my career on social media, and I'm not anxious about it. 

You want to know the real root cause? Inequality. People are anxious because the system is rigged. They're working harder than ever and getting nowhere. They can't afford homes, can't afford healthcare, can't afford education. 

They see billionaires launching rockets while they're drowning in student debt. And yeah, I'm wealthy-I know that. But I also know what it's like to hustle, to work every day, to build something. 

And I see the system now from the inside, especially working on criminal justice reform. People are anxious because they know the game is fixed. Poor people go to prison for decades for non-violent crimes while wealthy people get away with everything. 

The justice system is broken. The economic system is broken. And people know it. They feel it every day. So they're anxious because they're working as hard as they can and the system is designed to keep them down. 

My prescription? Use your platform, whatever it is, to change the system. I'm using mine to help people get out of prison, to reform sentencing laws. Everyone has some kind of power-use it to make things fairer. Because until the system is more just, until people can actually get ahead through hard work, the anxiety isn't going away."

The moderator thanks them all. The audience sits in silence for a moment, processing eight different diagnoses of the same American malaise: civic disengagement, absence of presence, institutional distrust, impatience with progress, loss of humor, intellectual laziness, digital performance, and systemic inequality.
Perhaps they're all right.

The moderator concludes with five thoughts capturing the essence of these remarkable women:

1. Democracy dies not in darkness but in the lazy comfort of the couch, where citizens scroll through outrage instead of organizing it into action, mistaking the performance of opinion for the practice of citizenship.

2. A life lived entirely for an audience-curated, filtered, and monetized-is not a life at all, but a frantic performance where the actor has forgotten there was ever supposed to be a person beneath the role.

3. Justice moves with the maddening pace of glaciers, not because it is weak but because it must be permanent, and those who demand revolution by morning will find themselves exhausted by noon while those who plant seeds wait patiently for forests.

4. The truth still exists but requires the dying art of investigation-real questions, primary sources, uncomfortable conversations-not the lazy tribalism of choosing which liar to believe based on which lies feel most comfortable.

The evening would end with grudging respect, a few genuine laughs, and Lebowitz complaining about having to take the subway home. Roosevelt would shake everyone's hand. RBG would nod approvingly. Rivers would already be writing material about the whole thing. Swift would post a thoughtful Instagram. Kardashian would post a selfie. Stein would say something incomprehensible that somehow makes perfect sense. And Kilgallen would be taking notes for her column.

The real magic? Watching women from different eras-from the Modernist 1920s to the social media 2020s-realize they've all fought the same battles in different costumes.
