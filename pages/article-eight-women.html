    <h2>The Opening</h2>

    <p><span class="stage-direction">A moderator introduces the panel. Lebowitz immediately complains about the uncomfortable chair and asks if anyone has a cigarette, even though you can't smoke there. Swift sits up straight, prepared and gracious. Kardashian is checking her phone. RBG has her reading glasses on, reviewing notes. Rivers would already be making jokes about everyone. Roosevelt remains poised. Stein might say something cryptic like "A panel is a panel is a panel." Kilgallen is sizing everyone up like a detective.</span></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>On Fame and Public Life</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Moderator:</span> "What does it mean to be a public woman?"</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "It's a responsibility. You have a platform, you must use it for good."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "It's a nightmare. Everyone thinks they deserve your attention. I became famous for complaining about exactly this."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "I think it's about connection—reaching people through art and using that connection to make change."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "It's about building something. I built businesses, I'm studying law, I'm helping people get out of prison."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "It's about survival, honey. They want you young, they want you pretty, they want you quiet. I said 'screw that' and kept talking."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">RBG:</span> "It's about doing the work. The recognition is secondary to the jurisprudence."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Stein:</span> "The public is there there, but the work is here."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kilgallen:</span> "It's about asking the questions no one else will ask."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>On Being Underestimated</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "They said a woman couldn't host late night. So I did it. Then they punished me for it. But I survived."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">RBG:</span> "I was asked at Cornell how it felt to take a spot that could have gone to a man. I said I was here to learn."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "Everyone thought I was just famous for nothing. Now I'm taking the bar exam. Surprise."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz</span> <span class="stage-direction">(rolling her eyes):</span> "Everyone underestimates everyone. That's what people do. They're stupid."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "They keep trying to diminish what I've built, calling it manufactured or saying I didn't write my own songs. So I just keep the receipts."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "They said the First Lady should serve tea and smile. I held press conferences for women journalists only and wrote a daily newspaper column."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>On New York City</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "New York is over. It's been over since 1975. Now it's just a mall for rich people."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "I've been hearing 'New York is over' my whole life. It's never over. It just gets more expensive and more neurotic, which is perfect for comedy."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "I lived at Washington Square. The city taught me that democracy requires proximity to different people and ideas."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kilgallen:</span> "The city is where the stories are. The gossip, the crime, the secrets—it's all here."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "I wrote about New York as this magical place. I know that's naive, but that dream of New York matters too."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "I'm more of an LA girl, honestly."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "Obviously."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>On Art and Commerce</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Stein:</span> "Art is what we do. Commerce is what happens afterward, if at all."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "But why shouldn't artists get paid? I fought Spotify, I'm re-recording my albums. Art has value, literally."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "Everyone wants to be paid now. Used to be you made art because you had to. Now everyone's a brand."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "What's wrong with being a brand? I employ people, build businesses. That's creative too."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "Look, I did QVC. I sold jewelry. You know why? Because Johnny Carson blacklisted me and I had bills to pay. Commerce kept me alive to do the art."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">RBG:</span> "The law protects both artistic expression and commercial rights. They're not mutually exclusive."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "But we must ask: does the work serve only ourselves, or does it serve the greater good?"</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>On Speaking Your Mind</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kilgallen:</span> "I asked questions about the Kennedy assassination that made powerful people uncomfortable. That's the job."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "I say what I think. People hate it. I don't care. Caring what people think is a full-time job, and I already have one."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "Comedy is telling the truth. If they're not a little offended, you're not doing it right."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "I stayed quiet politically for years because I was afraid. Then I realized silence was a choice too, and not a neutral one."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "Social media changed everything. You can speak directly now, without filters. But everyone has an opinion about everything you say."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">RBG:</span> "I learned to speak carefully but firmly. 'I dissent' became more powerful because I used it strategically."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to speak despite it."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Stein:</span> "Words are words. Make them new."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Clash</h2>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz</span> <span class="stage-direction">(to Swift and Kardashian):</span> "Do either of you ever read books?"</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Swift:</span> "Of course! I reference literature in my songs all the time—'The Great Gatsby,' Emily Dickinson..."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kardashian:</span> "I'm reading law books right now, actually. Constitutional law, criminal procedure..."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Lebowitz:</span> "I mean real books. For pleasure. Without posting about it."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "Oh please, Fran. Not everyone needs to be a public intellectual. Some of us just entertain people and make millions. It's honest work."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Roosevelt:</span> "I think we should celebrate all forms of contribution. Miss Swift reaches millions of young people. Miss Kardashian is learning law to help the incarcerated. These are valuable pursuits."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">RBG:</span> "Indeed. I was underestimated too. We all were. Perhaps we should extend the same benefit of the doubt we wish we'd received."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Stein:</span> "A contribution is a contribution is a contribution."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kilgallen:</span> "Can we get back to the gossip? Who here has dated someone scandalous?"</p>

    <p><span class="stage-direction">Everyone looks at everyone else.</span></p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Rivers:</span> "Oh honey, we're all scandalous. That's why we're interesting."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Closing Speeches: On American Anxiety</h2>

    <p><span class="stage-direction">The moderator asks for closing comments.</span></p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Eleanor Roosevelt:</span> "The anxiety you feel is the anxiety of having enormous power—the power to vote, to speak, to organize—and not using it. You are anxious because you know, deep down, that you are capable of more than you are doing. The answer is not to retreat into fear, but to advance into action."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude Stein:</span> "The anxiety is the anxiety is the anxiety. You have replaced experience with performance, replaced being with seeming. A rose is a rose is a rose—but you photograph the rose, filter the rose, post the rose, and never actually smell the rose."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Dorothy Kilgallen:</span> "The root cause of this anxiety is that nobody trusts anything anymore—and they're right not to. The truth is still out there, but you have to be willing to chase it down like a reporter on deadline."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Ruth Bader Ginsburg:</span> "We are anxious because we have become impatient with the slow work of progress. Real change is incremental. It is one case, one law, one vote at a time. Your anxiety is a call to action, not paralysis."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Joan Rivers:</span> "You're all too damn serious. You've lost your sense of humor, and that's killing you. Stop taking everything so personally. Stop thinking your feelings are legislation. And for God's sake, learn to laugh at yourself. Can we talk?"</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Fran Lebowitz:</span> "The root cause is simple: you're all stupid now. You've outsourced your thinking to algorithms, your opinions to influencers. Read a book. A long one. Be bored for five minutes. Your anxiety is your brain begging you to use it again."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Taylor Swift:</span> "We're more connected than ever but lonelier than ever. The root cause is that we've let technology corporations monetize our attention and our anxiety, and we've forgotten that we can just... log off."</p>

    <p><span class="speaker">Kim Kardashian:</span> "The real root cause? Inequality. People are anxious because the system is rigged. Use your platform, whatever it is, to change the system. Everyone has some kind of power—use it to make things fairer."</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>

    <p>The audience sits in silence, processing eight different diagnoses of the same American malaise: civic disengagement, absence of presence, institutional distrust, impatience with progress, loss of humor, intellectual laziness, digital performance, and systemic inequality.</p>

    <p>Perhaps they're all right.</p>

    <p>The evening ends with grudging respect, a few genuine laughs, and Lebowitz complaining about having to take the subway home. Roosevelt shakes everyone's hand. RBG nods approvingly. Rivers is already writing material about the whole thing. Swift posts a thoughtful Instagram. Kardashian posts a selfie. Stein says something incomprehensible that somehow makes perfect sense. And Kilgallen takes notes for her column.</p>

    <p><strong>The real magic? Watching women from different eras—from the Modernist 1920s to the social media 2020s—realize they've all fought the same battles in different costumes.</strong></p>
