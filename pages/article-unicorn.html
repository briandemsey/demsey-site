    <p>Trophy Animals and Actuarial Tables

Presenting an actuarial report to a client became my first exposure to real wealth, a visit to the Hickok Family Mansion. The S. Rae Hickok Professional Athlete of the Year award, commonly known as the Hickok Belt, was a trophy awarded to the top professional athlete of the year in the United States, first awarded from 1950 to 1976, dormant for decades, then revived in 2012. The entry hall was, it seemed then, as large as a football field, filled with trophy animals. One was a polar bear standing on its hind legs, at least 12 feet tall.

Another experience was meeting with airline and insurance company executives at the Wings Club in NYC to defend a proposal to save Pan American Airlines. The Wings Club was born in New York City on May 15, 1942, when a number of America's aviation leaders decided to band together to find a suitable meeting place where they could gather to help chart the future course of aeronautics.

Then there was the meeting with Chip Yablonsky, whose father Jock was the president of the United Mine Workers. The discussion involved the Union, mine operators, and the White House to avert a nationwide strike.
I am neither a stranger to hard work nor the notoriety of acquaintances. However, I was always home for dinner, and our travel was as a family of five.

Work/life balance has always been uppermost in my planning and goal setting. Perhaps because I knew from actuarial training that my life expectancy would be brief based upon the early demises of my father and grandfather. As an actuary, I learned to calculate risk, to measure time in probabilistic terms, to understand that longevity is never guaranteed. It shapes how you think about every day, every decision, every trade-off between the office and everything else.

Those meetings at the Wings Club, those negotiations to save airlines and avert strikes, those visits to mansions filled with polar bears-they were part of my work. Important work. High-stakes work. But they never consumed my life. I made it home for dinner. When we traveled, we traveled as a family.

So when I look at Silicon Valley's unicorn founders-the billionaires running companies worth hundreds of billions, the CEOs committing $600 billion over three years while simultaneously building fortress compounds-I find myself asking: What does work/life balance mean when you're trying to build artificial general intelligence? When your company is valued at half a trillion dollars? When the CIA's venture capital arm is backing your surveillance technology?

The answer, I've discovered, is that they're not looking for balance at all. They're looking for something else entirely.

The White House at 9 PM on a Thursday

On September 4, 2025, President Trump hosted 33 Silicon Valley leaders at a White House dinner in the newly renovated Rose Garden. It was 9 PM on a Thursday night. For most Americans, that's when you're helping kids with homework, watching television, winding down. For Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, it was time to thank Trump for being a "pro-business, pro-innovation president" and promise to "invest a ton in the United States."
Mark Zuckerberg was there too. When Trump asked him directly how much he was planning on committing to the U.S., the Meta CEO didn't hesitate: "$600 billion through 2028."

Six. Hundred. Billion. Dollars.

This is what passes for an evening out in Silicon Valley's unicorn class. Working dinners aren't interruptions to life-they are the life. The line between professional obligation and personal time dissolved long ago, replaced by something that looks more like empire-building than employment.

Thirteen billionaires attended that dinner. The combined market cap of Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies had hit an all-time high of $14.3 trillion just months earlier. The region is home to 273 unicorns-private companies valued at over $1 billion-worth nearly $1 trillion combined. San Francisco alone hosts 204 unicorns, more than any city in the world.

And yet, notably absent from the dinner was Elon Musk, amid an ongoing feud with Trump. Also missing: Nvidia's Jensen Huang, known for avoiding such gatherings. Even at the pinnacle of power and influence, some unicorn founders choose invisibility over the spotlight.

Which raises the question: Is the real luxury not attending the White House dinner? Is true work/life balance having enough power to say no to the President?

I've been to the Wings Club. I've sat in rooms with people who could avert nationwide strikes with a phone call. But I've never met anyone who thought the work-no matter how important-should consume every waking hour, who thought building a career meant never going home.

The Geography of Escape

Here's what Sam Altman was doing when he wasn't dining with the President: expanding his San Francisco compound.

Altman's primary residence is a massive Russian Hill mansion on Lombard Street, purchased in March 2020 for $27 million. Last month, he closed on deals for three properties adjacent to his San Francisco residence, spending around $14-38 million to expand his compound. He's not just buying a house; he's buying an entire block, creating a fortress in one of San Francisco's most exclusive neighborhoods.
He's not alone.

Mark Zuckerberg owns at least 11 properties in Palo Alto's exclusive Crescent Park neighborhood, creating a fortress costing more than $110 million. He also reportedly maintains a residence at 3450 21st Street in San Francisco. When you're running a company valued in the hundreds of billions, apparently, one home isn't enough. You need a compound. You need a moat. You need to ensure that your neighbors are... yourself.
This is the new geography of work/life balance in Silicon Valley: not separating work from life, but separating yourself from everyone else.

The Hickok mansion had trophy animals and a 12-foot polar bear. These Silicon Valley compounds have something else: isolation as aspiration. The Hickoks built a mansion to display their success to the world. Altman and Zuckerberg are building compounds to hide from it.

The pattern is clear across the unicorn landscape. These founders aren't creating boundaries between office and home-they're eliminating the need for boundaries by controlling every square foot of their environment. Work from anywhere? Sure. As long as "anywhere" is within your $110 million fortress where the outside world can't reach you.

When I calculated life expectancy tables as an actuary, I learned that wealth correlates with longevity. But I never imagined it would lead to this: billionaires so successful they're literally buying out their neighbors to avoid human contact.

The Stealth Mode Life

If Altman and Zuckerberg represent the visible end of the unicorn spectrum-White House dinners, public commitments, society pages-there's an entire shadow world of unicorn founders who've chosen a different path: complete invisibility.

Safe Superintelligence, founded in June 2024 by Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI, operates in what the industry calls "stealth mode." The company raised $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation while revealing almost nothing about what it's actually building. Investors include Nvidia, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz-the most sophisticated money in Silicon Valley betting billions on a company that won't tell them what it's doing.
Sutskever left OpenAI's chaos and public scrutiny to build AGI in secret with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy from offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. The company claims to be working on "revolutionary engineering" to develop "safe superintelligence," but operates with such secrecy that it makes the CIA look transparent.

And speaking of the CIA: Palantir Technologies spent years as Silicon Valley's most infamous secretive unicorn before going public in 2020. The company was backed by In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, and cofounded by billionaire Peter Thiel. Palantir is known for being "ultra secretive," selling technology that scans through huge amounts of data looking for patterns, used by law enforcement and spy agencies to investigate crimes and spot potential terrorist plots.

For Palantir's founders, work/life balance meant building technology so sensitive that secrecy wasn't a preference-it was the business model.

This is the ultimate work/life integration: when your work requires CIA-level operational security, when your investors sign NDAs just to hear your pitch, when your entire company operates in stealth mode, there is no "life" separate from work. There's only the mission, shrouded in secrecy, funded with billions, and hidden from public view.

When I worked on averting the United Mine Workers strike, the negotiations were sensitive. Lives and livelihoods hung in the balance. But we still went home at night. We still had families. We still understood that secrecy was a tool, not a lifestyle.

The question I keep asking myself: Is this balance, or is this disappearance?

The AI Boom Changed Everything

Ten years ago, in 2015, Silicon Valley's biggest names were a diverse group. Apple, Google, Facebook, Oracle, Intel, Cisco-the established giants. The unicorns of that era included Airbnb, whose CEO Brian Chesky made TIME's 100 Most Influential People list. There was Coinbase, which had just raised a record-breaking $75 million for a bitcoin company. And there was Theranos, where Elizabeth Holmes was celebrated as America's youngest female billionaire, running a $9 billion biotech company.

We all know how that turned out. It was, employees later admitted, "sort of an open secret that [Theranos technology] wasn't real." The extreme secrecy that Holmes maintained wasn't protecting intellectual property-it was hiding fraud.

Fast forward to 2025, and the unicorn landscape has transformed completely. The AI boom has created unprecedented scale and unprecedented pressure. OpenAI raised $40 billion in a single funding round in March 2025, giving it a valuation of $500 billion. Anthropic has raised $33.74 billion total, with its last funding in September 2025 for $13 billion, giving it a $183 billion valuation. Databricks is valued at $100 billion.
These aren't companies-they're economic superpowers.

AI companies alone now command multi-billion-dollar rounds as routine occurrences. In 2024, mega-rounds of $100 million or more surged, particularly in AI and deep tech. VCs doubled down on startups with demonstrable traction in AI, enterprise SaaS, clean energy, and next-gen semiconductor companies. As of October 2025, 79 companies achieved unicorn status in 2025 alone, with strong prospects of surpassing 2024's total of 86 new unicorns.

When the stakes are this high-when you're racing to build artificial general intelligence, when nation-states are competing for AI supremacy, when your company's valuation can swing by tens of billions in a single funding round-what does "taking a weekend off" even mean?

Anthropic outlines a path to break-even in 2028, whereas OpenAI doesn't project profitability until 2030. These aren't quarterly earnings targets; these are existential timelines. The pressure isn't to hit your numbers this quarter-it's to build AGI before your competitor does, to shape the future of human civilization, to ensure that superintelligent AI is aligned with human values.

In my actuarial work, I learned to think in probabilities and timeframes. But even I struggle to comprehend the temporal pressure these founders operate under. They're not managing quarterly earnings-they're managing the trajectory of human technological evolution.

In the 1980s, saving Pan Am felt urgent. Averting a coal strike felt critical. But we knew those were problems with solutions, negotiations with endpoints. What these founders are doing has no endpoint-only an ever-accelerating race toward a future no one can fully predict.

The Contradiction They Live With

Here's where it gets interesting: These same founders who are building fortress compounds, operating in stealth mode, and attending White House dinners at 9 PM are the ones preaching "wellness" and "mindfulness" to the rest of us.

Every tech CEO has a morning routine Medium post. They all meditate. They all journal. They all optimize their sleep with eight-sleep mattresses and Oura rings. They talk about the importance of presence, of being in the moment, of disconnecting from technology.

And yet they're simultaneously:

Committing $600 billion over three years
Raising $1 billion while revealing nothing about their product
Expanding multi-property compounds to avoid neighbors
Working with spy agencies on surveillance technology
Racing to build artificial general intelligence
Attending presidential dinners on Thursday nights

The cognitive dissonance is staggering.

Strategic Visibility

But maybe that's the point. Maybe the real "balance" they've achieved isn't between work and life-it's between visibility and invisibility, between public influence and private fortress-building, between the appearance of accessibility and the reality of complete separation.

Sam Altman can be at the White House thanking Trump for being pro-innovation one week, and buying out his San Francisco neighbors the next. He's mastered the art of being seen exactly when-and only when-he chooses to be.

Mark Zuckerberg can commit $600 billion in a public forum while living in a $110 million compound designed to keep the public far away.

Ilya Sutskever can leave the world's most visible AI company (OpenAI) to build superintelligence in complete stealth mode, funded with a billion dollars from the world's most sophisticated investors.

This is the new definition of work/life balance among unicorn founders: not boundaries, but optionality. Not separation, but strategic visibility. Not time off, but total control over when, where, and how you engage with the world.

What Balance Actually Means at This Altitude

As someone who spent a career calculating risk and probability, I've come to understand that work/life balance means different things at different altitudes.

For most people, balance means leaving work at 5 PM, having weekends free, taking vacations without checking email. It means boundaries.

For unicorn founders, "balance" means something entirely different:
Control. Building compounds so large you never have to leave your bubble. Spending $14-38 million to buy out your neighbors isn't creating work/life balance-it's creating a moat between you and everyone else's life.
Optionality. Operating in stealth mode when you want privacy (Safe Superintelligence), making public commitments when you want influence (the White House dinner). The luxury isn't time off-it's choosing when to be visible.

Integration. When your life's mission IS building AGI, or disrupting industries, or preventing AI catastrophe, there is no "off." Work isn't something you do from 9-5; it's the organizing principle of existence. Anthropic's path to 2028 profitability isn't a business plan-it's a worldview.

Resources. When you can spend $110 million on a residential compound, when you can raise $40 billion in a single round, when you can commit $600 billion over three years, you don't need work/life balance-you need work/life dominance. You need to ensure that every aspect of your environment serves your mission.

The pattern I see from my vantage point-someone who understood early that time is finite, that life expectancy isn't guaranteed-is that these founders have made a calculation. They've decided that the work they're doing is so important, so world-changing, so existentially critical, that traditional notions of balance don't apply.
And maybe they're right. Maybe when you're building artificial general intelligence, you can't take weekends off. Maybe when you're committing $600 billion to American infrastructure, you can't leave work at the office. Maybe when you're developing safe superintelligence, secrecy isn't paranoia-it's prudence. But I also see the cost.

The Paradox I'm Living

I should confess something: I'm working harder now than I ever have. At 83, I'm building Hallucinations.cloud, an AI safety startup. I spend 6-10 hours daily on development. I've just successfully submitted my first iOS app to Apple's App Store after resolving complex technical challenges. I'm writing this column as part of a bid to become a journalist. I'm pursuing patent applications for distributed watermarking technology.
And honestly? I'd like to become a unicorn too.

So am I a hypocrite for questioning Silicon Valley's approach to work/life balance while working myself into the ground at an age when most people are long retired?

I don't think so. And here's why:

The difference isn't in the hours worked-it's in the isolation chosen.

I'm not building a compound to escape my neighbors. I'm not operating in stealth mode. I'm not hiding behind NDAs and LLCs. I'm building in public, sharing ideas, engaging with the world rather than retreating from it.
When I was younger, work/life balance meant going home for dinner, traveling as a family of five. Now, with my children grown and my actuarial awareness of time sharper than ever, balance means something different: working on what matters, with whom I choose, on my own terms.

The Silicon Valley unicorns and I are both working obsessively. But they're working obsessively while separating from life-building fortress compounds, operating in secrecy, choosing invisibility.

I'm working obsessively while engaging with life-building technology to detect AI hallucinations, writing to share observations, creating rather than isolating.

Maybe that's the real distinction: Not whether you work hard, but whether your work connects you to the world or separates you from it.

Sam Altman is spending $14-38 million to buy out his neighbors. I moved to South Dakota for clarity and perspective, not isolation.

Ilya Sutskever is building AGI in stealth mode with $1 billion. I'm building AI safety tools and writing about the industry openly.

Mark Zuckerberg is committing $600 billion while living in a $110 million compound. I'm building a startup at 83 hoping to become a unicorn while living in a place where people still talk to their neighbors.
So yes, I'm working harder now than ever. And yes, I'm pursuing unicorn status. But I'm doing it without building walls-literal or metaphorical-between myself and the rest of humanity.

The Question No One's Asking

In a city with 204 unicorns worth nearly $1 trillion, where 13 billionaires can gather for dinner with the President on a Thursday night, where founders spend tens of millions building compounds to escape their neighbors, maybe the real question isn't "how do they achieve balance?"

Maybe the question is: "What are they balancing against?"

When you've redefined success as building AGI, as preventing AI catastrophe, as shaping the technological future of civilization, traditional work/life balance looks quaint. It looks small. It looks like something people with smaller ambitions worry about.

What the Actuarial Tables Know

But here's what my actuarial training taught me: No matter how much money you make, no matter how large your compound, no matter how world-changing your mission, you still have the same 24 hours as everyone else. You still age at the same rate. Your life expectancy, for all your billions, doesn't increase proportionally with your net worth.

I've stood in the Hickok mansion beneath a 12-foot polar bear. I've negotiated with mine workers and airline executives. I've worked on problems that affected thousands of lives. And every night, I went home to dinner with my family. Every trip, we traveled together-all five of us.
Not because my work wasn't important. But because I knew something these unicorn founders seem to have forgotten: The polar bear is just a trophy. The mansion is just a building. The billion-dollar valuation is just a number.
And at the end-which comes for all of us, unicorn founders included-no one wishes they'd spent more time at the office. Or at White House dinners. Or in stealth mode building AGI.
The unicorn founders redefining Silicon Valley aren't looking for work/life balance-they're looking for work/life dominance, for complete control over their environment, for the resources to never need boundaries because they've eliminated everything beyond their moat.
From Altman's expanding Russian Hill empire to Sutskever's stealth superintelligence lab, from Zuckerberg's $600 billion commitment to Palantir's CIA-backed secrecy, the message is clear: Balance isn't about boundaries. It's about having enough resources to never need them.
But I can't help wondering: When they're 83, like me, looking back on lives spent building empires and chasing superintelligence, will they think they got the balance right?
Or will they realize that the real unicorn-the truly mythical creature-wasn't a billion-dollar company at all, but the time they spent building moats when they could have been building connections?
That might be the ultimate work/life balance question: Not how hard you work, but whether your work brings you closer to life or further from it.
I'm working harder than ever at 83, chasing my own unicorn dreams. But I can still walk outside and talk to my neighbors. I can still write openly about what I'm building. I can still engage with the world rather than retreat from it.
The Silicon Valley billionaires building fortress compounds have achieved something remarkable: They've created a new definition of success that requires complete separation from the very world they claim to be improving.

I'd rather fail at becoming a unicorn while staying connected to humanity than succeed at becoming one while disappearing behind a $110 million moat.

Because in the end, the actuarial tables don't care about your net worth. Time runs out for all of us at the same relentless pace. And when it does, the only thing that matters is whether you spent it building walls or building bridges.

The unicorn has always been a mythical creature. But in 2025 Silicon Valley, the real myth is that you can buy your way out of the human condition-that enough money, enough security, enough control can somehow exempt you from the fundamental truth that we're all in this together, for the brief time we're here.

They can't. And no amount of stealth mode funding or White House dinners will change that.
